# Welcome to my Blog and Portofolio

Hi and welcome to my blog. My name is Christina and I am a scientist turned Developer. I have been working as a Software Engineer and teaching myself coding and debugging skills.

Coding, I run into many challanges on a daily basis so I created this blog to give back to the community. Seriously, if you are just starting out, you are not alone. We are all here to help each other.

Over time, through lots of trial and error, and learning from others, I have discovered strategies to implement and debug. I want to share them with you.

Check out my Blog posts below and I would love to hear from you. Let me know what you think, ask me a question or let me know if there is a better way of solving something. Learning together is the best part of the job.

Happy Hacking!
